# 1 Decode and inspect every field
openssl x509 -in client.crt -text -noout

# 2 Confirm it chains to our CA (Expected: client.crt: OK)
openssl verify -CAfile myCA.crt client.crt


# 3 Ensure the cert matches its private key (Both MD5 hashes must be identical)
openssl x509 -noout -modulus -in client.crt | openssl md5
openssl rsa  -noout -modulus -in client.key | openssl md5
